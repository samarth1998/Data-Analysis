# Data-Analysis

This is a project for my COGS 108 (Data Analysis) class.

During the first lecture, you all answered a simple questionnaire, resulting in a messy CSV file containing the following information: your year at UCSD, major, age, places lived, gender, height, weight, favorite ice cream flavor, and favorite color. In this assignment, you will use this dataset to work through a simple data science project - using a dataset to come to an informed conclusion about a question of interest - using several analysis techniques along the way.
Tasks / Learning Goals
This project has two main objectives:
- To work through a template of a full project: going from background work and
hypotheses, exploring and checking a relevant dataset, doing hypothesis driven data analysis, exploring potential confounds and/or alternative explanations and ultimately coming to an informed conclusion regarding the research question.
- To explore and apply data analysis methods, including linear modelling, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
